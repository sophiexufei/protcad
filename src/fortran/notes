con9.0 : this version only looks at (and outputs) the difference
	between pairwise and non-pairwise

con9.1 : this version will be modified back to the original to
	actually calculate the energies using the random mixing
	approximation for testing of the misfolds.


B series: same idea as above, only the categorization of atoms into
environment types directly follows chemical lines: C, N, O, S

con9.2 : a version of con9.1 which simply gives a 'bad' energy for
	a cluster which is never seen

The following series of programs is based upon the series above.  These versions
however have been significantly rewritten to use less memory by condensing the
large arrays holding energy, etc. and allowing a mapping from another array.
